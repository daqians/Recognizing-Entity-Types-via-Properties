### Abstract:
The mainstream approach to the development of ontologies is merging ontologies encoding different information, where one of the major difficulties is that the heterogeneity motivates the ontology merging but also limits high-quality merging performance. Thus, the entity type (etype) recognition task is proposed to deal with such heterogeneity, aiming to infer the class of entities and etypes by exploiting the information encoded in ontologies. In this paper, we introduce a property-based approach that allows recognizing etypes on the basis of the proper- ties used to define them. From an epistemological point of view, it is in fact prop- erties that characterize entities and etypes, and this definition is independent of the specific labels and hierarchical schemas used to define them. The main contribu- tion consists of a set of property-based metrics for measuring the contextual simi- larity between etypes and entities, and a machine learning-based etype recognition algorithm exploiting the proposed similarity metrics.
